## 🎯 Problem Statement
Title: The Burden of Regulatory Compliance: A Real Challenge

Storytelling:

Imagine a bank’s compliance team in the middle of a regulatory reporting cycle. They're buried under mountains of spreadsheets, data files, and regulations.

The clock is ticking. The team has to ensure that every piece of data submitted for regulatory reporting is accurate and compliant with the latest requirements.

But here’s the catch: the regulations are constantly changing. New rules are added, existing ones are amended, and sometimes, the data that the team has doesn’t even match the format regulators require.

Current Process: They painstakingly go through each data set, manually defining validation rules, cross-checking against regulations—hoping they don’t miss something critical.

Pain Point: This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and ultimately, a huge bottleneck in the bank’s ability to remain compliant.
