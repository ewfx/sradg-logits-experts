# Streamlit Application using OpenAI API

## Running the Streamlit App
To start the Streamlit application, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This command will launch the application in your web browser.

## Configuration

### Setting the OpenAI API Key
To use the OpenAI API, you must set your API key as an environment variable securely.

#### Windows:
```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_openai_api_key"
```
* This sets the variable for the current command prompt session.
* To make this setting permanent, add it to the Environment Variables in the System Properties.

#### Linux/macOS:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_openai_api_key"
```
* This sets the variable for the current terminal session.
* For a persistent setting, add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).

### Accessing the API Key in Code
Your application can retrieve the API key using:
```python
import os
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
**Important:** Never hardcode your API key in your application code for security reasons.
